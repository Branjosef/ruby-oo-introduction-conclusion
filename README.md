# Intro to Object Orientation Conclusion

Now we should have a basic grasp on object-oriented programming. As discussed in
this module, we should have an understanding of the concept of "objects" that
can contain data and/or code, such as attributes and methods.

In this module we explained the concept of local variables and instance
variables, as well as instance methods. We can now set instance variables from
our `#initialize` method and have been introduced to global and variable scope.

What we will be able to achieve is shared functionality throughout the application
as needed. You're well on our way to having enough knowledge of OOP to develop
your own fully functional applications!
